Rancher UI
--------

Perhaps you like managing cattle.

[![Build Status](http://drone.rancher.io/api/badge/github.com/rancher/ui/status.svg?branch=master)](http://drone.rancher.io/github.com/rancher/ui)

## Usage

Prerequisites:
* [Bower](from http://bower.io/)
* [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) 0.12.x (with NPM)

If you're on a Mac and use Homebrew, you can follow these steps:
```bash
  brew install node watchman
  npm install -g bower
```

Setup:
```bash
  git clone 'https://github.com/rancher/ui'
  cd 'ui'
  git submodule init
  git submodule update
  npm install
  bower install
```

Run development server:
```bash
  npm start
```

Connect to UI at http://localhost:8000/ .  The server automatically picks up file changes, restarts itself, and reloads the web browser.

Run development server pointed at another instance of the Rancher API
```bash
  RANCHER_ENDPOINT="http://rancher:8080/" npm start
```

RANCHER_ENDPOINT can also be `hostname[:8080]` or `ip[:8080]`.

### Compiling for distribution

The built-in cattle server expects to be run from `/static/` and hosted on a CDN.  To generate the CDN files, run:
```bash
  ./scripts/build-static
```

### Running Tests

```bash
  npm install -g ember-cli
```

* `ember test`
* `ember test`
* `ember test --server`
