      Before adding your first service or launching a container, you must add at least a single Linux host that supports Docker {minVersion} or higher and be able to reach the {appName} server via HTTP. {appName} supports adding Linux hosts in the form of a virtual or physical
          machine from any public cloud providers, privately hosted clouds, or even bare metal servers.
