      Before adding your first service or launching a container, you must add at least a single Linux host that supports Docker {minVersion} or higher and be able to reach the {appName} server via HTTP. {appName} supports adding Linux hosts in the form of a virtual or physical

Docker containers, as an increasingly popular application workload, create new requirements in infrastructure services such as networking, storage, load balancer, security, service discovery, and resource management.
