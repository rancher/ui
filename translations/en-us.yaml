      <p>{appName} supports grouping resources into multiple environments. Each one gets its own set of services and infrastructure resources, and is owned by one or more GitHub users, teams or organizations.</p>
        <p>For example, you might create separate "dev", "test", and "production" environments to keep things isolated from each other, and give "dev" access to your entire organization but restrict the "production" environment to a smaller team.</p>

  host:
    header: What is a host?
    content: |
      Before adding your first service or launching a container, you must add at least a single Linux host that supports Docker {minVersion} or higher and be able to reach the {appName} server via HTTP. {appName} supports adding Linux hosts in the form of a virtual or physical
          machine from any public cloud providers, privately hosted clouds, or even bare metal servers.

        A service is simply a group of containers created from the same Docker image but extends Docker's "link" concept to leverage {appName}'s lightweight distributed DNS service for service discovery. Services can be added individually or by deploying an item from the Catalog.
      paragraph2: A service is also capable of leveraging other {appName} built-in services such as load balancers, health monitoring, upgrade support, and high availability.

        {appName} is an open source software platform that implements a purpose-built infrastructure for running containers in production. Docker containers, as an increasingly popular application workload, create new requirements in infrastructure services such as networking, storage, load balancer, security, service discovery, and resource management.
