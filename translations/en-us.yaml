      <p>{appName} supports grouping resources into multiple environments. Each one gets its own set of services and infrastructure resources, and is owned by one or more GitHub users, teams or organizations.</p>
        <p>For example, you might create separate "dev", "test", and "production" environments to keep things isolated from each other, and give "dev" access to your entire organization but restrict the "production" environment to a smaller team.</p>

      Before adding your first service or launching a container, you must add at least a single Linux host that supports Docker 1.9.1+ and be able to reach the {appName} server via HTTP. {appName} supports adding Linux hosts in the form of a virtual or physical
          machine from any public cloud providers, privately hosted clouds, or even bare metal servers.

        {appName} is an open source software platform that implements a purpose-built infrastructure for running containers in production. Docker containers, as an increasingly popular application workload, create new requirements in infrastructure services such as networking, storage, load balancer, security, service discovery, and resource management.
