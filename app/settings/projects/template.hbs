    <p>Rancher supports grouping resources into multiple <b>environments</b>.  Each one gets its own set of services and infrastructure resources, and is owned by one or more GitHub users, teams or organizations.</p>
    <p>For example, you might create separate &quot;dev&quot;, &quot;test&quot;, and &quot;production&quot; environments to keep things isolated from each other, and give &quot;dev&quot; access to your entire organization but restrict the &quot;production&quot; environment to a smaller team.</p>
