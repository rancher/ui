    <p>
      Before adding your first service or launching a container, you must add at least a single Linux host that supports Docker 1.9.1+ and be able to reach the {{settings.appName}} server via HTTP.
      {{settings.appName}} supports adding Linux hosts in the form of a virtual or physical machine from any public cloud providers, privately hosted clouds, or even bare metal servers.

    <h2>Adding your first Service</h2>
    <p>
      A service is simply a group of containers created from the same Docker image but extends Docker's &quot;link&quot; concept to leverage {{settings.appName}}'s lightweight distributed DNS service for service discovery.
      Services can be added individually or by deploying an item from the Catalog.</p>
      <p>A service is also capable of leveraging other {{settings.appName}} built-in services such as load balancers, health monitoring, upgrade support, and high-availability.
