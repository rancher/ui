# Pages

If you have page-specific styles, it is better to put them in a `pages/` folder, in a file named after the page. For instance, itâ€™s not uncommon to have very specific styles for the home page hence the need for a `_home.scss` file in `pages/`.

*Note â€” Depending on your deployment process, these files could be called on their own to avoid merging them with the others in the resulting stylesheet. It is really up to you.*
